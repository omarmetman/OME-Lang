## ✨ Features

- ✅ Simple and clear syntax
- ✅ Full English language support
- ✅ Built-in mathematical functions
- ✅ Advanced text processing capabilities
- ✅ User input handling
- ✅ Real-time date and time functions
- ✅ Variables and constants
- ✅ Arithmetic and logical operations
- ✅ Import external files
- ✅ Debug mode for development

## 🚀 Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository to your local machine
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ome-lang.git
cd ome-lang

💻 Usage
# Run an OME program
python ome.py program.ome

# Run with debug mode enabled
python ome.py program.ome --debug

📚 Examples
Basic Example:
let name = "Ahmed"
print "Hello " + name + "!"
print "5 + 3 = " + (5 + 3)

Advanced Example:
# Calculate circle area
let radius = 10
let area = PI * (radius ^ 2)
print "Circle area: " + area

# Get user input
print "What is your name?"
input userName
print "Welcome " + upper:userName

📖 Complete Documentation
Variables:
let x = 10
let name = "OME"
let isActive = TRUE
let emptyValue = NULL

Printing Output:
print "Simple text"
print "Text with variable: " + x
print "Math operations: " + (10 + 5 * 2)

Arithmetic Operations:
+  -  *  /  %  ^

Logical Operations:
==  !=  <  >  <=  >=

Built-in Functions:
sin:angle      # Sine function
cos:angle      # Cosine function  
tan:angle      # Tangent function
sqrt:number    # Square root
abs:number     # Absolute value
round:number   # Round number
random:        # Random number between 0-1
now:           # Current date/time
length:text    # Text length
upper:text     # Convert to uppercase
lower:text     # Convert to lowercase

User Input:
input variableName

Importing Files:
import "other_program.ome"

Constants:
PI     # 3.141592653589793
E      # 2.718281828459045
TRUE   # Boolean true
FALSE  # Boolean false
NULL   # Null/none value

🎯 Sample Programs
hello.ome:
# Welcome program in OME
let name = "Omar"
print "Hello, " + name + "! 🚀"

# Math operations
let a = 15
let b = 7
print "Sum of " + a + " and " + b + " is: " + (a + b)
print "Multiplication result: " + (a * b)

# Using math functions
print "Sine of 45: " + sin:45
print "Square root of 64: " + sqrt:64

# Using constants
print "PI value: " + PI

advanced.ome:
# Advanced program showing OME capabilities

# Math functions
print "=== Math ==="
print "2^8 = " + (2 ^ 8)
print "10 % 3 = " + (10 % 3)

# Comparison operations
print "=== Comparisons ==="
let x = 10
let y = 20
print "x < y: " + (x < y)
print "x == y: " + (x == y)

# User input
print "=== Input ==="
print "What is your age?"
input age
print "Your age is: " + age

# Text functions
print "=== Text Processing ==="
let text = "Hello World"
print "Text: " + text
print "Text length: " + length:text
print "Uppercase: " + upper:text

# Date and time
print "=== Time ==="
let current_time = now:
print "Current time: " + current_time
